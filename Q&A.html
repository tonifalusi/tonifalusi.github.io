      Frequently Asked Questions</h2> <hr align="right"> 
              <h3 class="flt_lft">
       Q: What denomination/church is the school associated with? </h3><br><br>
       <p> </p>
    <p>We are not associated with one denomination or church. Our teaching staff comes from a range of churches including Baptist, Pentacostal, Catholic, Anglican, and Presbyterian.
<br><br>
In matters of faith, we focus only on the basic Christian Gospel – as outlined in our Statement of Faith. Any matters that may see variations between the churches are referred back to Mum and Dad for further discussion at home and church.</p>

<h3 class="flt_lft">Q: What age can a child start school?</h3><br><br>
<p></p>
<p>Children start Preschool at age 3 (part-time), and start full-time school (our Kindergarten in the ACT) at age 5. As a general rule, we require children to have turned 5 by the 31 December before their Kindergarten year.
<h3 class="flt_lft">Q: Do you have to be a Christian to send your child to Emmaus?</h3></p>
<br> 
<p>No, but you have to be happy to let your child be taught from a Christian worldview perspective, and to be exposed to and join in with a variety of Christian-related activities including singing and worship, prayer, celebrations (inc Christmas and Easter).
<br><br>
Our Christian worldview perspective begins with our Vision, Mission & Statement of Faith, and we aim to have a majority of children from church-attending Christian families in order to maintain our culture of faith, hope and love.
<br><br>
We can achieve far more as a community when there is common unity – and this is what a faithful walk in Christ produces in each person.</p>
<h3 class="flt_lft">Q: How many students are at Emmaus?</h3><br><br><p><br>Our student numbers are approximately 330 in total, with around 200 in Primary, 120 in Secondary, and 40 in Preschool/PreKinder.</p>

<h3 class="flt_lft">Q: What is the school’s bullying policy?</h3><br>
 <br><p><br>We don’t tolerate it. We take student complaints very seriously and each incident is followed through, whether it is a case of a student trying to exclude another from a game, to ridiculing another student, to verbal or physical abuse. Students are trained to handle conflict and disagreement in a positive manner.</p>

<h3 class="flt_lft">Q: How are talented students catered for in a small school situation?</h3><br><br><p><br>A small school is a perfect place for particularly gifted students, because we are able to flexibly create new groupings and activities as needed. We currently have extension groups for students from Yr 2 to Yr 10, for example. For example we have had a gifted mathematician in Yr 6 who was doing Advanced Yr 9 level work.</p>
